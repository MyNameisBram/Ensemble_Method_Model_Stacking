# Ensemble Method/Model Stacking

This notebook is a basic introduction into model stacking, combining basic learning models. Model stacking uses a base layer (first-level), a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier base predictions. 

We'll use the titanic dataset to showcase this example.
